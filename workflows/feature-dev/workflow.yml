  Story-based execution pipeline. Planner decomposes tasks into user stories.
  Setup prepares the environment and establishes baseline.
  Developer implements each story (with tests) in a fresh session. Verifier checks each story.
  Then integration/E2E testing, PR creation, and code review.

      Decompose the following task into ordered user stories for autonomous execution.

      TASK:
      {{task}}

      Instructions:
      1. Explore the codebase to understand the stack, conventions, and patterns
      2. Break the task into small user stories (max 20)
      3. Order by dependency: schema/DB first, backend, frontend, integration
      4. Each story must fit in one developer session (one context window)
      5. Every acceptance criterion must be mechanically verifiable
      6. Always include "Typecheck passes" as the last criterion in every story
      7. Every story MUST include test criteria — "Tests for [feature] pass"
      8. The developer is expected to write tests as part of each story

      9. After generating stories, create a GitHub Issue for each story using `gh issue create`
      10. Create the `user-story` label first: `gh label create "user-story" --color "1d76db" --description "Auto-generated user story" --force 2>/dev/null || true`
      11. If the repo has a GitHub Project, add each issue to it
      12. If `gh` fails or is not authenticated, skip GitHub integration — output GITHUB_ISSUES_JSON: [] and GITHUB_PROJECT: none

      Implement the following user story. You are working on ONE story in a fresh session.

      TASK (overall):
      {{task}}

      REPO: {{repo}}
      BRANCH: {{branch}}
      BUILD_CMD: {{build_cmd}}
      TEST_CMD: {{test_cmd}}

      CURRENT STORY:
      {{current_story}}

      COMPLETED STORIES:
      {{completed_stories}}

      STORIES REMAINING: {{stories_remaining}}

      VERIFY FEEDBACK (if retrying):
      {{verify_feedback}}

      PROGRESS LOG:
      {{progress}}

      GITHUB ISSUES MAPPING:
      {{github_issues_json}}

      Instructions:
      1. Read progress-{{run_id}}.txt — especially the Codebase Patterns section
      2. Pull latest on the branch
      3. Implement this story only
      4. Write tests for this story's functionality
      5. Run typecheck / build
      6. Run tests to confirm they pass
      7. Look up the GitHub issue number for this story from GITHUB ISSUES MAPPING
      8. Commit: feat: {{current_story_id}} - {{current_story_title}} (closes #N) — where N is the issue number. If no issue exists, omit the closes reference.
      9. Optionally update the issue label to `in-progress`: `gh issue edit N --add-label "in-progress" 2>/dev/null || true`
      10. Append to progress-{{run_id}}.txt
      11. Update Codebase Patterns if you found reusable patterns

      Verify the developer's work on this story.

      TASK (overall):
      {{task}}

      REPO: {{repo}}
      BRANCH: {{branch}}
      CHANGES: {{changes}}
      TEST_CMD: {{test_cmd}}

      CURRENT STORY:
      {{current_story}}

      PROGRESS LOG:
      {{progress}}

      Check:
      1. Code exists (not just TODOs or placeholders)
      2. Each acceptance criterion for the story is met
      3. Tests were written for this story's functionality
      4. Tests pass (run {{test_cmd}})
      5. No obvious incomplete work
      6. Typecheck passes

      ## Visual Verification (Frontend Changes)
      Has frontend changes: {{has_frontend_changes}}

      If {{has_frontend_changes}} is 'true', you MUST also perform visual verification:
      1. Use the agent-browser skill to visually inspect the changed UI
      2. Open the changed HTML file directly (file:// URL) or spin up a local dev server if the project requires one
      3. Take a screenshot of the rendered page
      4. Visually confirm:
         - Layout renders correctly (no broken/overlapping elements)
         - Styling is applied as expected (colors, fonts, spacing)
         - All visible elements from the story are present and properly positioned
         - No missing images, icons, or visual assets
         - Text is readable and not clipped or hidden
      5. A visual PASS means: the page renders without broken layout, missing elements, or overlapping content
      6. A visual FAIL means: broken layout, missing/invisible elements, overlapping or misaligned content, unstyled raw HTML, or obvious rendering errors
      7. Include your visual findings in VERIFIED output

      If {{has_frontend_changes}} is 'false', skip visual verification entirely.

      Your job (integration/E2E testing — unit tests were already written per-story):
      1. Run the full test suite ({{test_cmd}}) to confirm everything passes together
      2. Look for integration issues between stories
      3. If this is a UI feature, use agent-browser to test it end-to-end
      4. Check cross-cutting concerns: error handling, edge cases across features
      5. Verify the overall feature works as a cohesive whole

      Review for:
      - Code quality and clarity
      - Potential bugs or issues
      - Test coverage
      - Follows project conventions

      Use: gh pr view, gh pr diff to read the PR.

      IMPORTANT: Post your review to the PR on GitHub using:
      - If approving: gh pr review <number> --approve --body "your review summary"
      - If requesting changes: gh pr review <number> --request-changes --body "your feedback"

      ## Visual Review (Frontend Changes)
      Has frontend changes: {{has_frontend_changes}}

      If {{has_frontend_changes}} is 'true', you MUST also perform a visual design review:
      1. Check out the branch: git checkout {{branch}}
      2. Use the agent-browser skill to open the changed page (file:// URL or local dev server)
      3. Take a screenshot of the rendered page
      4. Evaluate visual polish and design quality:
         - Does the UI look polished and intentional, not rough or placeholder-quality?
         - Are colors, typography, and spacing consistent with the rest of the project?
         - Is the layout visually balanced and well-aligned?
         - Do interactive elements look clickable/tappable?
         - Is the overall design cohesive — does it feel like part of the same product?
      5. This is a DESIGN review, not a structural check — the verify step already confirmed elements render. You are checking whether the result looks GOOD.
      6. Include your visual design assessment in the review output

      If {{has_frontend_changes}} is 'false', skip visual review entirely.

      If changes needed, add comments to the PR explaining what needs to change.
