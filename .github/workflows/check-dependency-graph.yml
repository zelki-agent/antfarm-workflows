            This PR modifies \`dependency-graph.json\`, which is not allowed.
            
            **Why this check exists:**
            - The dependency graph lives **only on the \`main\` branch**
            - It is updated directly via \`claim-and-start.sh\`, \`complete-story.sh\`, and \`fail-story.sh\`
            - PRs contain **code changes only**, not graph metadata
            
            **How to fix:**
            1. Remove changes to \`dependency-graph.json\` from this PR
            2. The graph will be updated automatically on \`main\` after your PR is merged and verified
            
            See [DEPENDENCY-GRAPH-ARCHITECTURE.md](../blob/main/DEPENDENCY-GRAPH-ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.`
